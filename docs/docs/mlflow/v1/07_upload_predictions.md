## Performance Analysis

The first submission results are quite encouraging. Scoring **0.96715** puts me in a strong position - this is genuinely close to perfect prediction with an AUC near 1.0. The **gap to leader is only 1%**, which shows our model selection and MLflow pipeline are working well.

Being ranked 1,427th might seem disappointing at first glance, but it's important to remember this is a popular competition with thousands of participants. The **performance difference is actually quite small**, suggesting I'm on the right track.
